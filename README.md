# Docker for Machine Learning 
This tutorial demonstrates using Docker for machine learning with a simple Apple and Tomatoes dataset. It compares training a model with and without Docker, showcasing how containerization simplifies setup, ensures consistency, and improves reproducibility. The guide covers both approaches' data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this tutorial is the Apple and Tomatoes Image Classification dataset, which can be accessed from Kaggle:

Apple or Tomatoes Image Classification Dataset

This dataset contains images of apples and tomatoes, and is used to demonstrate how to train a machine learning model to classify between the two classes. You can download the dataset and upload it to your environment for use in this tutorial.
