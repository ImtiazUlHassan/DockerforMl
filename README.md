# Docker for Machine Learning

This tutorial demonstrates using Docker for machine learning with a simple Apple and Tomatoes dataset. It compares training a model with and without Docker, showcasing how containerization simplifies setup, ensures consistency, and improves reproducibility. The guide covers both approaches' data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this tutorial is the **Apple and Tomatoes Image Classification Dataset**, which can be accessed from Kaggle:

[Apple or Tomatoes Image Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/apples-or-tomatoes-image-classification)

This dataset contains images of apples and tomatoes, which are used to demonstrate how to train a machine learning model to classify between these two classes. You can download the dataset from Kaggle and upload it to your environment for use in this tutorial.
